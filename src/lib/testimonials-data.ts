    review: 'Received my order of Chocolate and Red Velvet Cookies. The chocolate ones were soft with a nice balance of sweetness, and the red velvet had a smooth, subtle flavor that wasn‚Äôt too much. Both were fresh and arrived on time, delivered to Delhi in perfect condition. They didn‚Äôt feel too heavy, just the right amount of indulgence. Solid choice for a quick sweet fix!',

The packaging is sustainable and robust and you can safely pack and send them to your loved ones in other countries as well! 10/10 would order again!',

    review: 'This is the second time I‚Äôm ordering from √í Four, the chocolate hazelnut cake is to die for, and so are the eggless brownies which are so moist and filled with high quality chocolate that you can feel it melt in your mouth. Eggless options are replaced with secret ingredients which make the desserts just as good as any eggless ones. HIGHLY recommend the new innovations Shruti comes up with from time to time. THEY CAN MAKE YOU ANY DESSERT EVEN IF IT‚Äôs NOT ON THE MENU. 100% recommend',
